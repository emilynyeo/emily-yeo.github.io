This paper highlighted the significance of early feeding patterns in shaping the infant fecal metabolome and their potential implications for neurodevelopment. 

Our study systematically investigated how varying levels of breastfeeding, formula feeding, and the introduction of solid foods at 1 and 6 months of age influence the metabolic profile of infants. Through the collection of fecal samples and subsequent analysis via untargeted liquid chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry, we found significant associations between feeding practices and specific metabolites that may correlate with early neurodevelopmental indicators.
