The PhD Comprehensive Exam is known to bea daunting task for many students. It is aimed as a test of your knowledge and understanding of your field of study. It is also a test of your ability to think critically and solve problems. 

How it worked 
======
Most PhD programs require students to take a comprehensive exam as part of the PhD program. The exam can take many forms, but the most common one is a written or oral exam, followed by a question session. For my department, it invloved submitting a research project proposal, followed by presentation of this project 2 weeks later, then a question session from the committee (panel of professors). 

My Research Proposed
======
The overall aim of the project is to apply machine learning methods to integrate multi-omics data from 155 participants in a 12-month comprehensive lifestyle weight loss intervention, and explore omic features, and combinations of features, predictive of BMI and its changes throughout the intervention. Additionally, the proposal outlines the steps needed to integrate multiple omic layers and assess improvements in prediction accuracy compared to models based solely on clinical data.

I passed - now what?
======
Excellent question! Now I get to work on my project and publish it. Wish me luck and stay tuned for the paper update!
