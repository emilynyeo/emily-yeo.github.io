Hi, I'm Emily
------
This website is a work in progress and will be updated soon 

Background 
------
I grew up on the gorgeous East coast of South Africa, and did my undergrad in Biochemistry at the University of Stellenbosch (near Cape Town). If you know me, and haven't done so already, you'll likely have been told to go visit South Africa ASAP. 

I moved to Boston, USA in September 2020 (excellent time to move to a new city not knowing anyone) to complete a masters degree in Biochemical and Molecular Nutrition at the Friedman School of Nutritional Science and Policy, Tufts University. During this time I learned what a "real winter" meant, spent countless hours running along the Charles, and met wonderful friends (including a now more than friend - husband).

Not quite done nerding, I decided to pursue a PhD at the University of Colorado Boulder, and we moved out West in September 2022. My research now focuses on using multi-omic modeling frameworks to predict health outcomes in various epidemiological cohorts. This is in conjuction with the Biomedocal Informatics Department at the University of Colorado Anschutz. My interests largely revolve around this idea of precision health and medicine - essentialy, how can we improve health by personalizing treatments, therapeutics and patient recomendations based on unique factors auch as genetics, microbiomics, and clinical and socio-economic influences of each indiviadual.

When I'm not nerding, I'm most likely running up mountains with the Trail Team and friends, catching a theater show/concert, or travelling somewhere new.

At this point this quote is deeply planted in my psychy, but started out as a joke between my dad and I.
