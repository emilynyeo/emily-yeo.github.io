Hi, I'm Emily
------
This website is a work in progress and will be updated soon 

Background 
------
I grew up on the gorgeous [KwaZulu-Natal North Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Coast_(KwaZulu-Natal)) of South Africa, and did my undergrad in Biochemistry at the University of [Stellenbosch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellenbosch_University) (near Cape Town). If you know me, and haven't done so already, you'll likely have been told to go visit South Africa ASAP. 

I moved to Boston, USA in September 2020 (excellent time to move to a new city not knowing anyone) to complete a masters degree in [Biochemical and Molecular Nutrition](https://nutrition.tufts.edu/academics/degrees-programs/specializations#bmn) at the Friedman School of Nutritional Science and Policy, Tufts University. During this time I learned what a "real winter" meant, spent countless hours running along the Charles, and met wonderful friends (including a now more than friend - husband).

Not quite done nerding, I decided to pursue a PhD at the University of Colorado Boulder, and we moved out West in September 2022. My research now focuses on using [multi-omic](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10390758/figure/mco2315-fig-0005/) modeling frameworks to predict health outcomes in various epidemiological cohorts. This is in conjuction with the [Biomedical Informatics Department](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/dbmi) at the University of Colorado Anschutz. My interests largely revolve around this idea of precision health and medicine - essentialy, how can we improve health by personalizing treatments, therapeutics and patient recomendations based on unique factors auch as genetics, microbiomics, and clinical and socio-economic influences of each indiviadual.

When I'm not nerding, I'm most likely running up mountains with the [Trail Team](https://www.trail-team.com/in-person-training-boulder) and friends, catching a theater show/concert, or travelling somewhere new.

This quote started out as a joke between my dad and I, and is now somewhat of a mantra.
